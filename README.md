A minimal ASP.NET Core web API demo for experimenting. Various learning resources are collected here.

# Concepts

* Model-View-Controller (MVC) - a common software design pattern; under .NET Core, controllers are the implementations of service end-points, models are data sources for the controllers, and views are the web pages that are served to the client; Microsoft uses "MVC" as a noun to describe a web service implementation
* Routing - in the context of web services, routing is how requests to a URL are mapped to service methods that generate the response; we say that requests are routed to a handler

# Techs

* .NET Core - open source, portable platform based on ASP.NET MVC, maintained by Microsoft
* .NET Framework - platform for .NET applications on Windows, maintained by Microsoft
* .NET Standard - the .NET platform standard, defines common functionality between platforms including .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Mono
* Mono - portable implementation of the .NET Framework, maintained by Xamarin
